# dindin12138's Homebrew Tap

This is my personal Homebrew Tap repository.

I created this small repository simply to host and manage specific packages I use daily that are either unavailable in the official Homebrew repositories or require a specific version (like older releases).

## 📦 How to Use

If you'd like to use the packages hosted here, first add this tap to your local Homebrew by running:

```bash
brew tap dindin12138/tap
```
